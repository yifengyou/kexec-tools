# This util helps to reduce the workload of kdump service restarting
# on udev event. When hotplugging memory / CPU, multiple udev
# events may be triggered concurrently, and obviously, we don't want
# to restart kdump service for each event.

# This script will be called by udev, and make sure kdump service is
# restart after all events we are watching are settled.

# On each call, this script will update try to aquire the $throttle_lock
# The first instance acquired the file lock will keep waiting for events
# to settle and then reload kdump. Other instances will just exit
# In this way, we can make sure kdump service is restarted immediately
# and for exactly once after udev events are settled.
