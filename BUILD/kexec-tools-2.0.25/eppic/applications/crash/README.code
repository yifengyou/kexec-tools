The code directory is where Linux kernel analysis eppic code resides.

To make use of these files:
===========================

[1] Get and build the crash tool
    Crash is available from http://people.redhat.com/anderson.
    Build it with - 'make'

[2] Build the crash extensions as well
    Build these with 'make extensions'
    This will build crash/extenssions/eppic.so, the eppic engine for crash.
    
[3] Check out the eppic code files to a proper location for crash's use
    You can make these files available by checking them out to either /usr/share/eppic/crash or $HOME/.eppic.
    
    EXAMPLE:
       git clone http://code.google.com/p/eppic
       cp -r eppic/applications/crash/code/* $HOME/.eppic
    
[4] Load the eppic extension in your crash session
    crash> extend extensions/eppic.so
    Suggestion: add 'extend extensions/eppic.so' to your ~/.crashrc file so you do not have to do this every time 
    you fire up crash.
    The loading of eppic.so will also load the eppic code from the above mentioned locations.
    
At this point the new commands created by the eppic file load are evailable. 
For examnple, you can now type 'crash> ipcs -m' and it will execute the eppic code associated 
with that command (see code/ipcs.c).

Editing cycle.
==============
   Editing inside crash (with auto-reload):
   ========================================
   You can edit a file or function or from the location of the last eppic compile error from within crash itself. 
   Exiting from the editor will automatically re-compile the file and make your changes immediately effective.
    
   EXAMPLES:
      crash> edit -f ipcs.c    # edit the ipcs.c file
      crash> edit ipcs         # edit at the file:line# where function ipcs starts
      crash> edit -l           # edit at the file:line# where the last compile error occurred.

   Editing outside of crash itself.
   ================================
   When you use an external editor to modify the eppic files you must tell crash to reload the modified files. 
   You can either load a specific file or load all of the files from a directory.          
    EXAMPLES:
    crash> load ipcs.c    # re-compiles and loads the ipcs.c file only
    crash> load .         # re-compiled and loads of the files in ~/.eppic
